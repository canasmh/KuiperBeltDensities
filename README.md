This repository is used to study the effects of pebble accretion on small, low density, Kuiper belt objects

# The Formation of Kuiper belt objects

The Kuiper belt is a band of icy planetesimals and dwarf planets that lies just beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is a favorable place to study planet and planetesimal formation because many of these objects -- particularly the Classical Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are thought to have been undisturbed since its formation, serving as celestial *fossils* from which we can extract information of our young solar nebula
