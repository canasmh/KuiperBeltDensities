# Pebble Accretion and the Density Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects
This repository is used to study the effects of pebble accretion on small, low density, Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).

## The Kuiper belt

The Kuiper belt is a band of icy planetesimals and dwarf planets that lies just beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is a favorable place to study planet and planetesimal formation because many of these objects -- particularly the Cold Classical KBOs are thought to have been undisturbed since its formation, serving as celestial ***fossils*** from which we can extract information about the young solar nebula.
