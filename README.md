# Pebble Accretion and the Density Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects
This repository is used to study the effects of pebble accretion on small, low density, Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).

## The Kuiper belt

The Kuiper belt is a band of icy planetesimals and dwarf planets that lies just beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is a favorable place to study planet and planetesimal formation because many of these objects -- particularly the Cold Classical KBOs are thought to have been undisturbed since its formation, serving as celestial ***fossils*** from which we can extract information about the young solar nebula. Owing to the distance between us and the Kuiper belt, it can be difficult to measure the **mass** and **size** of these objects to any reasonable accuracy. However, if a Kuiper belt object happens to be part of a binary (i.e., it *has* or *is* a moon), we can measure get the mass of the objects by taking a look at their interactions. The size of a KBO can be calculated in the event of stellar occultation, i.e., the KBO passes in front of a background star. 

Kuiper belt objects in which we have been lucky enough to obtain both the size and mass, allows us to calculate the density of Kuiper belt objects. With size, distance and density, astronomers have revelead in interesting trend; small KBOs have low densities (0.5. g cm<sup>-3</sup>



## The Current Planet Formation Paradigm
Planet formation, like most things in astronomy, is a process that still requires much research and theories that seek to describe the mechanics of planet formation are constantly changing or otherwise evolving. One thing has been clear though, since the creation of the earliest telescopes. That is, there are planets! How did they get there? 

Powerful telescopes capable of observing young and distant protoplanetary disks, combined with our current understanding of how stars form, suggest that our early solar nebula was likely composed in large part of gas, mixed with micron to centimeter sized particles composed of silicates (rocks), volatiles (ices) and mixtures between the two. To achieve growth beyond cm-size scales to planetesimals, protoplanets
